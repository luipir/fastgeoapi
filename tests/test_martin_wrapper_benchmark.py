"""Throughput/latency benchmark for `build_martin_wrapper_app` (app/martin_wrapper.py).

Not a correctness test — `test_martin_wrapper.py` already covers that. This
drives `get_tile` requests through the sub-app's `TestClient` (in-process,
no real socket) to get a repeatable read on the wrapper's own overhead:

1. 100 warm-up requests, discarded, so the timed run doesn't pay for the
   TestClient/anyio startup cost or any lazy first-call work.
2. 1000 timed requests, from which mean/median/p95/p99 latency and an
   overall requests-per-second figure are computed and printed.

Every request targets a random `{z}/{x}/{y}` (with `0 <= x, y < 2**z`, the
only constraint martin-py's routing enforces) against the same single-point
fixture source `test_martin_wrapper.py` uses, so most tiles come back empty
of features but every one is a legitimate, independently-resolved tile
request, drawn fresh for warm-up and for the timed run alike — see
`tile_bench_support.py` for why nothing here is ever served from a cache.

There is no hard latency assertion: wall-clock speed is CPU- and
load-dependent, so pinning a threshold here would make the suite flaky on
slower CI runners. The test's pass/fail signal is correctness (every one of
the 1100 requests must resolve, not error) — the timing is reported, not
graded. Run `pytest -s tests/test_martin_wrapper_benchmark.py` to see it.
